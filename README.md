# :bar_chart: Product Recommendation Jupyter Notebook

This notebook contains Python code and explanations for building a product recommendation system. The system uses collaborative filtering techniques to suggest products to users based on their past interactions and preferences.

## Key Sections

1. **Data Preprocessing**: In this section, we load and preprocess the dataset, preparing it for recommendation model building.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Here, we explore the dataset to gain insights into user behaviors and product trends.

3. **Collaborative Filtering Models**: This section covers the implementation of collaborative filtering algorithms, including user-based and item-based approaches.

4. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate the performance of the recommendation models using relevant metrics.

5. **Recommendation Demo**: This part demonstrates how to use the trained model to make product recommendations for users.

## Requirements :gear:

To run this notebook, you'll need the following libraries and tools:
